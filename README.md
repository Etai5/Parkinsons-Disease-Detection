This project introduces a novel approach to detecting Freezing of Gait (FOG) in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) using a low-power Spiking Neural Network (SNN) algorithm. The framework utilizes accelerometer data to generate spikegram representations, offering an energy-efficient alternative to traditional time-series analysis and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based spectrograms.

The approach features data acquisition, resonator-based feature extraction, and classification using two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) â€“ a 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN. These models were evaluated against conventional machine learning classifiers, achieving competitive performance with a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 80.8% for the 1D-CNN, and 81.3% sensitivity with 78.1% specificity for the 2D-CNN. The proposed system provides an efficient and effective solution for real-time, wearable-device-based FOG detection.

The data used for this project was sourced from the Kaggle TLVMC Parkinson's Freezing Gait Prediction competition. This framework is designed to enable continuous, energy-efficient monitoring, improving the quality of life for individuals with PD.
